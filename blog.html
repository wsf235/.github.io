        BLOG POST #1:<br /><br />   By the end of Week #1, I researched the Agile Project Management Phases called Envision & Speculation.  I also learned how to use MEAN/LAMP Stacks for my "Open Source" Project using these server-side tools: Mongoose, ExpressJS, ReactJS, and Node.  I'm going continue practicing & improving my PHP/NODE Server-side Programming Skills so that I can learn more about the interaction between the front end and back ends of stacks.  I will do so by contributing my own UNIQUE "server-side" shopping cart feature (wish list, product ratings, another API besides Stripe.com, etc...) to my "Open Source" that allows the customer to post images via giphy while using the newly design website application.

        BLOG POST #2:<br /><br />
        (I've had this written for a couple days at this point, time has hated me this week) <br />
        I took a look into it during week 1 as well, but speculation is the phase where we decide which features to work with and about how much time it’d take to implement. The way I see it, a team can use this phase to mock up parts of the features they decide to work with.<br />

        Upon discussing with the team, three of our server-side features would be variable destructuring, the inclusion of es-lint, and the promisify method using the node utility class. Es-lint will help keep us in line as far as coding practices (though some of mine will still probably show through, because I’m a bit rebellious like that), the variable destructuring would allow us to get references to properties of objects instead of needing the entire object, and I still need to look into the promisify method that Matt and Cody spoke of.<br />

        We don’t particularly have an original source for our project, our original projects didn’t quite match up to what was required without doing a complete recreation of each project, which would’ve cost us a lot more time than what we have. Because of that, a custom built project was created so we could continue onward.<br />
