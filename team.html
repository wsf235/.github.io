    <h2>Agile Team Work</h2>

    <h3>Week 1</h3>
    <p>I'll reveal more as the time comes but for this week,
        I was forced <br />to take some time to get myself in
        order. This was <br />mainly done through getting my
        portfolio site up and running properly while making
        sure several other <br />things were organized as well.
        As far as the agile development <br />processes, the
        two phases focused on this week were about <br />
        planning and drawing out the scope and the functionality.</p>

    <h3>Week 2</h3>
    <p>Now that I've deemed myself caught up enough, I feel like<br />
    I can finally start to pull my own weight on the team, at least...<br />
    once I get back home from being out of town. I'm lacking majority of<br />
    my tools at the moment and this trip was forced on me so...<br />
    Let the next week begin with a cleaner schedule and less catching up!</p>
