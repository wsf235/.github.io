    <h2>Agile Team Work</h2>

    <h3>Week 1</h3>
    <p>I'll reveal more as the time comes but for this week,
        I was forced <br />to take some time to get myself in
        order. This was <br />mainly done through getting my
        portfolio site up and running properly while making
        sure several other <br />things were organized as well.
        As far as the agile development <br />processes, the
        two phases focused on this week were about <br />
        planning and drawing out the scope and the functionality.</p>

    <h3>Week 2</h3>
    <p>Now that I've deemed myself caught up enough, I feel like<br />
    I can finally start to pull my own weight on the team, at least...<br />
    once I get back home from being out of town. I'm lacking majority of<br />
    my tools at the moment and this trip was forced on me so...<br />
    Let the next week begin with a cleaner schedule and less catching up!</p>


    <h3>Week 3</h3>
    <p>
        The explore phase of Agile Development is the phase where the team<br />
        focuses on getting features completed and showing them off to each <br />
        other through stand-ups during and following their completion.<br /><br />

        While I have reached a point where I can finally be of aid to my team,<br />
        I’m still scanning through what’s been done thus far and where my place<br />
        is in all of this. As it stands, my unique feature to add is the Giphy <br />
        API, but that being said, there’s still more to work on than just that.<br />
        Even now, I still need to look into the other APIs like Socket.io, but <br />
        due to the amount of time remaining, I’ll only have time to skim it.<br /><br />

        As previously stated, we don’t particularly have an original source for <br />
        our project so we’re using a custom built project for this. Even now, <br />
        we're still in "preparation" phases, so to say. But as it stands, I think<br />
        steam will be picking up very quickly.<br />
