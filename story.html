    <p>Good afternoon all, I'm William Fenner and the two fastest ways to reach me
        are on Discord (Orenglaive#2836) or via email (wsf235@gmail.com). I can't
        say that I have any big ambitions to be honest, but I can say that I do have
        a goal that I'm in no hurry to reach, because I know that one day, I'll reach it. And that goal, or at least part
        of it was the project that I did for my Web Application Integration class,
        the Aul Compendium (has important tie-ins with my real goal). I'm currently
        also working on assembling my portfolio, it's definitely been neglected,
        ashamed as I am to say, so this is about the best I can show for now,
        <a href="https://github.com/wsf235/Portfolio">at this site</a> . But that being said, I look forward to
        working with you all this month!</p>
